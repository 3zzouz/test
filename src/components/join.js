              permission. You may not disassemble, decompile, or reverse
              engineer the Service or attempt or assist anyone else to do so,
              unless such restriction is prohibited by law. Your account must be

              provincial) applicable to your use of the Service and your Content
              (defined below), including but not limited to, copyright laws. In

              for such renewal on or after the renewal date associated with your
              account unless you have cancelled the Service prior to its renewal
              date. We may revise fee rates for the Service from time to time

              refund. Kindly note, however, that we reserve the right to revoke
              refund privileges (on an individual basis) if we determine abuse
              of this policy has occurred. Your Use of Our Service You must not

              Terms. Violation of these Terms may, in our sole discretion,
              result in termination of your account. Furthermore, we reserve the
              right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of these
              Terms to the fullest extent of the law. We may involve and
              cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting Users
              who violate the Terms. You acknowledge that we have no obligation
              to prescreen or monitor your access to or use of our Service or

              utilize any third party application in connection with your use of
              the Service, by doing so you are consenting to your Content being
              shared with such third party application. To understand how such
              third party application provider utilizes your Content and other
              information, you should review their privacy policy. General
              Conditions We may suspend or terminate your account(s) or cease
              providing you with all or part of our Services at any time without
              liability to you for any reason, including, but not limited to, if
              we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you
              create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) you have a
              free account that has not had any activity (replies or logins) for
              sixty (60) days, or trial accounts without a payment method thirty
              (30) days after expiration, or (iv) our provision of our Services
              to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable
              efforts to notify you through our Service, the next time you
              attempt to access your account, or by an email address or phone
              number you have provided us (if applicable). If we terminate your
              access to the Service, your Content and all other data will no
              longer be accessible through your account. Upon termination, all
              licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms will
              immediately cease. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,
              to change these Terms and/or our Services offered from time to
              time (“Updated Terms”). Unless we make a change for legal or
              administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice
              before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may
              notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service,
              and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the
              Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may
              reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated
              Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms and any Updated
              Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be
              effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be
              specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the
              Service from that point forward. These Terms will govern any
              disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated
              Terms.[a] We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to
              anyone for any reason at any time. You hereby authorize us,
              directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we
              consider necessary to validate your identity and/or authenticate
              your identity and account information. This may include asking you
              for further information and/or documentation about your account
              usage or identity, or requiring you to take steps to confirm
              ownership of your email address, wireless/cellular telephone
              number or financial instruments, and verifying your information
              against third party databases or through other sources. This
              process is for internal verification purposes. You further
              understand that we may charge a fee for this verification process.
              We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or
              monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine
              in our sole discretion violates these Terms. You …
